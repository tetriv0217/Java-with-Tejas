# Object Oriented Programming
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure code.
## Classes and Objects
- A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods that the objects created from the class will have.Class is basically a template for creating objects(designing a blueprint).
- An object is an instance of a class. It contains data and methods that operate on that data.

# How things work
Jdk ,jre and jvm.
- Jdk is top layer and jre is middle layer and jvm is bottom layer.
- Jdk is a software development kit that provides tools for developing Java applications. It includes the Java compiler, Java runtime environment (JRE), and other tools.
- JRE is a runtime environment that allows Java applications to run. It includes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and libraries needed to run Java applications.
- JVM is a virtual machine that executes Java bytecode. It provides a runtime environment for Java applications and is responsible for converting bytecode into machine code that can be executed by the host operating system.
